**Project Overview**

The project revolves around automating the process of publishing videos on Facebook using a dedicated account. The goal is to streamline the task of uploading videos, adding captions, and sharing them on the platform. The project relies on Selenium and the Undetected ChromeDriver library to interact with the Facebook Reels Composer page.

**What We Did for This Project**

1. **Imports**: The project begins with the necessary imports, including the use of `undetected_chromedriver` for a stealthy Selenium session, various Selenium libraries for web automation, `autoit` for file uploads, and the `time` module for controlling the timing of various actions.
2. **Login**: A Facebook account is used for the automation, and the user's email and password are defined. The script then navigates to the Facebook Reels Composer page and logs in using these credentials.
3. **Publish Function**: A custom function, `publish()`, is defined to automate the video publishing process. This function takes a URL, video file path, and optional captions as parameters.

   - The function navigates to the specified URL on Facebook.
   - It waits for the caption input field to appear and populates it with the provided captions.
   - The video file is uploaded using the `autoit` library, which simulates a file upload dialog.
   - The function proceeds to navigate through the steps required to publish the video on Facebook.
4. **Publish Loop**: A loop is created to repeatedly publish the same video with captions, simulating the process 25 times. This is done by calling the `publish()` function within the loop.
5. **Sleep**: The script sleeps for 15 seconds after the publishing loop to allow time for the publishing process to complete.

**Project Results**

The project demonstrates the automation of video publishing on Facebook through the Facebook Reels Composer. It successfully logs in, uploads a video, adds captions, and publishes the video multiple times. The project showcases the capabilities of Selenium, the Undetected ChromeDriver, and the `autoit` library in automating complex web interactions.
